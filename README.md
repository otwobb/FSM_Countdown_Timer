# Lab 2 #

This repository contains the source code submitted for the second, and final, lab of the Microcontroller Engineering II module.

This code is not perfect by any means and scored 84% in the assessment. Some issues that could've been fixed for higher marks include:

- Removing use of global variables
- Adding a countdown animation prior to timer starting
- Adding features from the instructions that I forgot about in the final build

When I have completed the module and gained more experience I will come back and improve the code.
